Hi there 👋

I’m Northes, an unknown ʕ◔ϖ◔ʔ enthusiast. A software engineer who specializes in back-end development, software architecture, cloud infrastructure, microservices and event driven. I am a person who works hard and always tries to learn something new. I love working with Go, PHP, Rust, Svelte, Vue and some cool stuff.
